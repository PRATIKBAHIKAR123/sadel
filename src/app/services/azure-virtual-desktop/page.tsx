      question: "What is a managed SOC?",
      answer: "A managed SOC (Security Operations Center) is a subscription-based service where a third-party team of cybersecurity experts monitors, detects, and responds to security threats across your IT infrastructure, endpoints, and data. This proactive approach helps businesses stay ahead of cyber risks and ensures rapid response to incidents."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the services in SOC?",
      answer: "SOC as a service includes continuous security monitoring, threat detection, vulnerability assessments, incident response, and reporting. These services leverage automation and data science to increase detection speed and reliability, providing 24/7 protection for your organization."
    },
    {
      question: "How does a SOC develop?",
      answer: "A SOC develops through five main stages: planning, designing, building, operating, and reviewing. Each stage involves defining processes, selecting tools, training staff, and continuously improving operations to adapt to evolving threats."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the role of the SOC Manager?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is a SOC MSP?",
      answer: "A SOC can be part of a Managed Service Provider (MSP) offering, giving clients access to a dedicated team of security analysts and advanced security tools. This model allows organizations to enhance their security posture without building an in-house SOC from scratch."
